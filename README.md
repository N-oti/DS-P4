# Starbucks Capstone Challenge


### Motivation

This project is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanoodegree , and the given dataset contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.
In this projectÂ , I'll build a model to predict how the customer will respond to a given offer based on demographics and offer type.
